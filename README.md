# NRF_LoRa

Custom PCB design based on the Nordic nRF52840 (QFN48) with an SX1262 LoRa module.

This board is intended as a low-power LoRa mesh node with optional peripherals, including a 0.96" I²C OLED, LiPo charging (MCP73831), fuel gauge (MAX17048), and a power multiplexer (TPS2116). USB-UART support is included via FT231XS.

The goal of this project is to learn and play with RF layout, MCU design, and board bring-up using modern wireless SoCs.
